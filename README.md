# Perceptron Algorithm Repository

This repository contains basic implementations of the Perceptron algorithm for various logical functions and a classification problem. These implementations are part of my master's curriculum in Machine Intelligence.

## Folder Structure

- `Perceptron OR Gate/`: Contains the Perceptron implementation for the OR logical function. Includes dataset and basic processing.
- `Perceptron AND Gate/`: Contains the Perceptron implementation for the AND logical function. Includes dataset and basic processing.
- `Perceptron XOR Gate/`: Contains the Perceptron implementation for the XOR logical function. Includes dataset and basic processing.
- `Perceptron Classification/`: Contains the Perceptron implementation for a classification problem. Includes dataset and basic processing.

## Datasets

Datasets for each logical function and the classification problem are included within their respective folders. The datasets are used for training and evaluating the Perceptron models.

## Basic Processing

The code includes basic processing steps and model implementations. Note that there is minimal preprocessing applied; the focus is primarily on the Perceptron model itself.

## Usage

To run the implementations:

1. Navigate to the respective folder for the logical function or classification problem.
2. Execute the script or notebook to train and evaluate the Perceptron model.




This work was completed as part of my master's curriculum in Machine Intelligence. 
Feel free to adjust the file names and any additional details according to your actual implementation!
